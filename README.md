# IEE-578-Reg-Analysis-Project

This repository was made for a Multivariate Regression course that I'm taking in my MSE program. My intention is to be a data scientist in the near future so I tried to use various tools that a data scientist would use. The tools that were used are:

1. Github
1. Jupyter Notebook
1. Google Cloud Services - Just so I can practice computing on the cloud and because i thought it would be faster. I started off with a sony vaio laptop that I installed Ubuntu on and the calculations seemed slow, so i decided to compute on the cloud. It really didn't help much. I believe what made the calculations slow on Jupyter was when I was querying directly from data.world and not the resources of my laptop. Which means it was probably my internet speed.
1. Data.world
1. JMP

I cannot take any credit for much of the process such as: gathering, cleaning and preparing data, and exploratory analysis. I imitated what nrippner did in data.world, https://data.world/nrippner/cancer-linear-regression-model-tutorial/contributors, you can visit the link if you please. I chose other regressor variables and did my analysis on JMP. Also, do to time constraints I made some minor changes. This is the first time I do this and thanks to nrippner and my regression class I learned a lot.

The all the data was uploaded to https://data.world/johnfox/cancer-analysis-hackathon-challenge. SQL and data.world was used for querying.

Since this wil be public please feel free to give me any feedback.
